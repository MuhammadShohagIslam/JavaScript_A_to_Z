/*
    JavaScipt Loops: Loops are handy, if we want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value

    Different Kinds of Loops:
        for => loops through a block of code a number of times
        for/in => loops through the properties of an object
        for/of => loops through the values of an iterable object
        while => loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        do/while => also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
