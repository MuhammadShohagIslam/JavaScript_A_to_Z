/*
    OOP: Object Oriented Programming is  a programming paradigm( the standard way of style define ) based on the concept of object, which can
    contain data, in the form of fields(ofthen known as attributes)
    and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods)
    *JavaScript is not actully a Object Oriented Programming Language.But we can work as a OOP.

    * Primitive Datas(Singular Data like Boolean, Number, String) are used to work with the OOP.
    *
    
    *** How to Think Everything as an Object ***
        => Everythink which takes multiple properties to describe is an Object.
        => Anythink to describe if we need multiple data
        => Even A Number can be an Object (Number: int, float, positive, negative)

    *** The method and properties of OPP ***
        Properties => is a term, which is described the characteristic of an Object and those which are stored into variable. like (Noun/Adjective of Grammer)

        Method: is a term, which can work of an object those which executable code and function ( like Verb of Grammer)

    *** The Class of OOP ***
        Class : is Just a Factory to Create Multiple Object without Code Duplication
            * Class is a just template of an Object.
            * We can create multiple object from a class
            * JavaScript does not have a class but we can works as a class.

    *** Four Pilars of OOP ***
        OOP stands on four main pilar:
            => Abstraction
            => Encapsulation
            => Inheritance
            => Polymorphism
